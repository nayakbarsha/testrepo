        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical <span class="bl bld-bigger">Latin</span> literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard <span class="rd bld-bigger">Hampden-Sydney </span> College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a <span class="bl bld-bigger">Latin</span> Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the <span class="bl bld-bigger">Latin</span>word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from <span class="bl bld-bigger">Latin</span>sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et <span class="rd bld-bigger">Hampden-Sydney </span>  Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, <span class="rd bld-bigger">Hampden-Sydney </span> written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", <span class="rd bld-bigger">Hampden-Sydney </span> comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>-->
